Sockets (I know I keep on yammering on about this) 
but where and how should I configure this. 
Keep in mind that the workflow requires sockets at a few points 
(but basically when they are logged in and the app is in an active state). 

When the user logs and is in the app (not backgrounded) 
they need to listen to events regarding user connects and 
disconnects to get a valid count of who is available 
(this is the availability data) to take a call.

When a call is made or is incoming they need to be able to get that signal 

When it goes from inactive (background) 
to active it should re-establish the connection 
if they are still logged in.

When they get out of a call or come back 
from a background state to an active state 
they should repull the availability data 
(and perhaps the profile data because this can change).

When they log out or spend too much time 
in the background state it should disconnect from the socket server. 
(but I have found that it does that on it's own in the background state 
but not necessarily in a graceful way.)
